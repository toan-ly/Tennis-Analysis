# Tennis Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to Tennis Analysis project! ðŸŽ¾ This is a project I've been working on to dive deeper into the world of sports analytics, specifically focusing on tennis. Leveraging advanced machine learning, deep learning and computer vision techniques, I've developed a system to analyze tennis players' performance in videos, providing insights into their speed, ball shot speed, and shot count. This project detects players and tennis ball using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and extracts court keypoints with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Demo

## Models Used
Here are the models I've used in this project:
#### Player Detection
* YOLO v8 for player detection
#### Tennis Ball Detection
* Fine-tuned YOLO v5 for tennis ball detection
#### Court Keypoint Extraction
* ResNet50 for tennis court keypoint

## Training
